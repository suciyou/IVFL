# IVFL

This is the official code repository for our method **IVFL** (Incremental Vision Foundation Learning), currently under review.

> 📌 **Note:** This is an initial implementation accompanying our paper submission. The code is still in its early stage and may lack full compatibility or robustness across different environments. We will continue to improve and maintain this repository as the work progresses.

## 🔧 Requirements

The main dependencies include but are not limited to:

- Python >= 3.8  
- PyTorch >= 1.11  
- numpy  
- tqdm  
- scikit-learn  

You can generate a complete list of installed packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````


## ⚠️ Usage Notice

At this stage, the code is **for reference only** and may **not run correctly out-of-the-box**.
We recommend using it mainly to understand the core ideas and structure.
Further updates and refinements will follow to make the code runnable and user-friendly.


## 📌 Disclaimer

This is a preliminary release. The codebase will be updated with more features, better documentation, and improved compatibility after peer-review and refinement.
